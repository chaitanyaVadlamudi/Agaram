    <p>Agaram is a participative drive, where likeminded people come together to help an under-privileged child reach his / her full potential through education. If you are someone who wants to make a difference in the life of a child, you can do that by contributing your time for our various initiatives. Agaram is an organisation that is completely run by volunteers. Volunteers are the pillars of strength for Agaram and they play a key role in every part of Agaram’s initiatives. Many of our projects would not be successful without their continuing support and contribution.</p>
    <p>Agaram also provides individualistic attention to every student through the mentorship program, by connecting every student with a mentor, who is not a parent or a teacher but someone who believes in the importance of education and the student’s ability to achieve. You can become a Mentor, if you have the inclination and the time.</p>
    <p>We do have an elaborate selection process to understand how you can partner with us, so that we mutually benefit from the engagement. Selected Volunteers and Mentors are then put through a training process, before they are deployed to support our various initiatives.</p></div>
